    <h1>About CampusConnect</h1>
    <p>
      CampusConnect is a student-built platform designed to simplify campus life. Whether you're trying to find a lost item, exchange books, buy second-hand electronics, or explore hostel essentials — this site brings it all together in one place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our mission is to help students connect and support each other by creating a digital marketplace and lost-and-found hub tailored to campus needs. It's easy to use, open to everyone in the college, and completely free.
    </p>
    <p>
      With categories ranging from books, electronics, fashion, and hostel stuff to events and stationery, CampusConnect serves as your one-stop solution for everyday campus life. You can also report lost/found items, post ads, or browse what's available.
    </p>
    <p>
      Created as a final year BCA project, this website is not just a submission — it’s a real-time tool meant to be helpful for students like us. We hope it grows into something bigger with your support!
